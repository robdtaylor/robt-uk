## TL;DR

CES 2026 wrapped with NVIDIA's next-gen Vera Rubin platform stealing the show. OpenAI launched a healthcare app built with 260 physicians. Anthropic closed a massive $10B round at $350B valuation. And the federal government is gearing up to fight state AI laws in court.

## Top Story: NVIDIA Unveils Vera Rubin Platform

NVIDIA officially launched **Vera Rubin**, the successor to Blackwell, featuring six new chips including the Vera CPU and Rubin GPU. The numbers are striking:

- **10x reduction** in inference token costs
- **4x fewer GPUs** needed for training Mixture-of-Experts models
- Major cloud providers committed to deploying Rubin-based "superfactories" in H2 2026

The company also unveiled **Alpamayo**, an open AI model for autonomous vehicle reasoning, and **Nemotron Speech ASR** for real-time voice recognition. Physical AI—robots and embodied systems—dominated the CES floor, officially dethroning "agentic AI" as the buzzword of choice.

## OpenAI Goes Healthcare

OpenAI debuted a dedicated **ChatGPT Health** experience, developed in collaboration with over 260 physicians. The app integrates with medical records and wellness apps to help users interpret lab results and prepare for appointments.

Key details:
- Purpose-built encryption for health data
- Conversations explicitly **not** used for model training
- Designed as a "digital advice nurse" for health guidance

Separately, OpenAI created a new **Head of Preparedness** role focused on frontier AI risk—covering threat modeling, cyber risks, biological misuse, and guardrails for self-improving systems. Sam Altman acknowledged "serious risks from rapid progress."

## Funding & Deals

**Anthropic** secured a **$10 billion funding round** at a $350 billion valuation, cementing its position as the leading OpenAI competitor. The company also shipped Claude Code 2.1.0 on January 7.

**Mobileye** agreed to acquire humanoid robotics startup **Mentee Robotics for $900 million**, marking a bold expansion from automotive autonomy into physical AI. Expected to close Q1 2026.

**OpenAI is exploring a Pinterest acquisition** to access the platform's ~200 billion images and intent-labeled visual data—a move aimed at strengthening ChatGPT's understanding of visual planning and competing with Google's search advantages.

## Policy Watch: Federal vs. State Showdown

The Trump administration is moving to preempt state AI laws. Key developments:

- **December 11**: Executive order establishing a "national policy framework" for AI
- **This week**: DOJ created an AI Litigation Taskforce to challenge state regulations as unconstitutional
- **January 1**: California, Texas, and Illinois AI laws went into effect despite federal pushback
- **Colorado** postponed its AI Act to June 30, 2026

This sets up a major federalism battle over who regulates AI in 2026.
